**EasyButton** is a small Arduino library for debouncing and reading momentary contact switches like tactile buttons. It uses callbacks to trigger actions when a button is pressed once or held for a given duration. It also provides a sequence counter to be able to rise an event when a given pattern of presses has been matched.
