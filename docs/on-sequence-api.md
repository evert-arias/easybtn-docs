`Event`

## Description

Triggers a callback function when the Button presses matches the given sequence pattern. This method takes three parameters as arguments. The first argument is the number of times to press the Button in order to trigger the sequence event. The second argument is the timeout in which the sequence has to reproduce in order to trigger the sequence event. The third argument is the callback function to be called.

```cpp
// Number of presses for the sequence
int number_of_presses = 5;

// Sequence timeout
int sequence_timeout = 2000;

button.onSequence(number_of_presses, sequence_timeout, onSequenceMatchedCallback);
```

## Example

Please refer to the [Detecting Sequence](on-sequence-example) example included in this documentation.
